    As a <span style = "color: rgb(70, 160, 251)"> RELIGOUS</span> gamer, I am big fan of videogames, primarily from Nintendo. 
    <br>Growing up I fell in love with <span style = "color: rgb(196, 43, 43)"> Mario</span> and <span style = "color: rgb(22, 170, 31)"> Luigi</span>, along with <span style = "color: rgb(227, 126, 190)"> Kirby</span>. Despite
    <br> <span style = "color: rgb(27, 88, 255)"> Sonic</span> being apart of SEGA, the blue hedgehog found a place in my heart along with the others.
    <p></p>
    <img class = "picture-asthetics" src ="images/big_3_Animes.png" height="280" width="390" alt="This picture includes major anime series like Naruto, One Peice, MHA, and etc. ">

    Video games aren't the only type of entertainment that have 
    <br>'intoxicaed' my brain with pure seretonin. Thanks to my brother, I was also able to <br>get into Anime as well. So far, i've fully completed (and watched several times) <span style = "color: rgb(243, 139, 35)"> Naruto Shippuden</span>,
    <br> and I am currently watching <span style="color: rgb(200, 213, 9)"> My Hero Academia</span>, <span style="color: rgb(33, 104, 191)"> Blue Lock</span>, <span style="color: rgb(196, 43, 43)"> One Peice</span> and <span style="color: rgb(0, 123, 82)">Demon Slayer</span>. Although, I do 
    <br>have to berate my brother for one thing, beacue starting me off with I high rated anime like
    <br> Naruto was a bad idea,considering now my expectations for anime series are WAY to high.
    <p></p>
    You probably wouldn't have guessed this next bit, but i'm known as a great singer 
    <br>between my family and my school. I've done many preformances at my school and
    <br> at many theatres, and safe to say im very proud of myself.

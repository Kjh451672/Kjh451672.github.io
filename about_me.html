    <h3>
        I was born in America, specifically in New York City. I live with my two brothers, and my mother and father.
        <br> My family has a very deep Jamaican backgorund, and decided to move over to America 
        <br>a few months after I was born. I went to P.S. 135 for 2-5th grade, and at the time of making this website,
        <br> I am currently learning at not only Medgar Evers College Prepatory School, but also the STEAM Center.
    </h3>

    <h3>
        Growing up, I was very non-verbal. When I was still young I didn't talk much and I mainly
        <br>pointed to communicate. Over time I learned to express myself in a more verbal manor. Making friends was
        <br> "tricky" to say the least. I was, and still am, a very sensitive person. But, during my time at Medgar
        <br> and meeting the vast variety of people really helped me open up by an extravagent amount.
        <br> I am Kyle Heaven, and this is my story. 
    </h3>
